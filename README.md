This project was designed to predict the movement and activities of senior citizens using sensor data, enabling real-time monitoring of their current activities. 

The data was originally stored in four separate datasets, categorized by rooms, groups, and other attributes, which were merged to facilitate comprehensive data analysis.

The workflow included data merging, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, predictive modeling, and deployment. 

Machine learning models were trained to accurately detect activity patterns, and the application was deployed using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for real-time monitoring and insights.
